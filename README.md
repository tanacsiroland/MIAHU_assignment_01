# Assigmnent description
- Platform: Moodle
- Create your own public repository on GitHub.
- Write any single class / program and write 2 types of test for it: ‘unit’ and ‘integration’.
- Set up GitHub actions to run the ‘unit’ tests for pull requests.
- Set up GitHub actions to run the ‘unit’ and ‘integration’ tests for every commit on master.
- Submit your repository’s link, which should contain successful test runs on master commit, and at least one PR with passing / failing test runs.
- The test results are irrelevant, you just need to demonstrate that you have tests, and they run when they must.
